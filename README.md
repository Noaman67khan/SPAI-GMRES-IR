Matlab codes perform Preconditioner in standard iterative refinement and GMRES iterative refinement
sir3.m is a function that uses preconditiner M iterative refinement with three precisions.
spai_hh,spai_ss,spai_dd for getting matrix M in half,single and double precision.
gmres_hh.m, gmres_dq.m and gmres_sd are functions for corrective terms in precisions half/half, single/double, and double/quad 
example_spai is a script for experiment on matrix orsirr_2 using sir3 and for GMRES the function is in comment in the same file.
