#### Matlab codes perform experiment using spai in GMRES-IR and SIR.
#### sir3.m is a function that uses preconditiner M iterative refinement with three precisions.
#### spai_hh,spai_ss,spai_dd for getting matrix M in half,single and double precision.
#### gmres_hh.m, gmres_dq.m and gmres_sd are functions for corrective terms in precisions half/half, single/double, and double/quad 
#### Example_spai is a script for experiment on matrix fs_183_1 using GMRES the function is in comment for spai-ir in the same file.
